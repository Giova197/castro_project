#How to run the project


In addition to this file, I am attaching a pdf to the email containing some useful images to understand how to run the project.


-Open the terminal from the "CastroProgetto" folder if the docker-compose.yaml file is present inside you are in the right place.

-Then open docker and, in the "Containers / App" section, start "castroprogetto" with the start button.

-At this point in the open terminal type docker-compose up.
To see the swagger go to
http://localhost:5000/index.html .

On this page you can see the diagram of the input and output produced.
Pressing on GET / Product and subsequent du "try it out" and then on "execute we can see the result.

-To make the request I used Postman. With the GET command http://localhost:5000/product .

-If we go to the address http://localhost:5050 we can see pgAdmin where all the data are contained, for the access credentials see the pdf attached to the email.
